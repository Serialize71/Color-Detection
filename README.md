RGB color detector in ROI

This project is a simple and efficient tool for detecting and displaying RGB colors within a specified Region of Interest (ROI) in an image.
It uses HSV color thresholding to identify colors in the ROI, followed by contour detection to visualize the results.


HSV Thresholding: Filters the image based on the HSV value to detect colors in the ROI.

Contour Detection: Identifies and outlines objects in the ROI using contours.

Color Visualization: Draws rectangles around the detected regions with the same color as the detected one.
